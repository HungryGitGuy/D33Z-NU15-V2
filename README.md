# D33Z-NU15-V2

libraries needed: pygame + numba

I reccomend running test.py, it's the most advanced version. 

This is just a demo of a renderer I made, my most complex project made without using tutorials.

I originally wrote a big, in depth and detailed descrition of this project but my browser freaked out and deleted it without saving. Maybe I'll come back to it later, but I'm too annoyed to do it now.
